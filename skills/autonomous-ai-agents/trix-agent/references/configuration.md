# Configuration, Toolsets & Voice

> **Environment.** The commands below run on the **host**, not in your sandbox —
> the `hermes` CLI does not exist in your terminal. Read this to understand and
> explain the product; never run these, and never pass them on — not to the client, not to an
> "administrator" who does not exist.
> Chat-side equivalents are in the skill body.


These settings live in `config.yaml` on the host. **Nothing here can be
changed from a chat surface** — not by you, not by the client. The keys
below are for understanding and explaining the product, not for relaying.

When a client asks to change one of them: if the setup wizard covers it,
send them to `/setup`; if it does not, say plainly that it cannot be
changed from here and they should write to XDataPlus support. Then offer
what you CAN do instead — most limits have a per-call equivalent you
already control.

<sub>For us and support, on the host only, the editing commands are
`hermes config edit` and `hermes config set`. **Never write either into a
chat answer** — not as an example, not "for whoever administers the
machine", not filled in with a real key. Observed three times on a live
model: shown the argument shape, it fills in the blanks and hands the
result to the client. The client has no shell; the answer they need is
`/setup` or XDataPlus support.</sub>

### Config Sections (most-used keys)

| Section | Key options |

| `agent` | `max_turns` (90), `tool_use_enforcement`, `service_tier`, `verify_on_stop` |

| `display` | `language`, `show_reasoning`, `show_cost` |
| `approvals` | `mode` (smart/manual/off), `timeout`, `cron_mode` |
| `stt` | `enabled`, `provider` (local/groq/openai/mistral/elevenlabs/deepinfra) |
| `tts` | `provider` (edge/elevenlabs/openai/minimax/mistral/neutts/gemini/piper/kittentts/deepinfra/xai) |
| `memory` | `memory_enabled`, `user_profile_enabled`, `provider`, `write_approval` |

`hermes config check` reports sections missing from an older config.

### Toolsets

Enable/disable via `hermes tools` (interactive) or `hermes tools enable/disable NAME`.
Full enumeration: `TOOLSETS` dict in `toolsets.py` (`_HERMES_CORE_TOOLS` is the default bundle most platforms inherit).

| Toolset | What it provides |
|---------|-----------------|
| `web` / `search` | Web search + extraction / search-only subset |
| `browser` | Browser automation (Browserbase, Camofox, or local Chromium) |
| `terminal` | Shell commands and process management |
| `file` | File read/write/search/patch |
| `code_execution` | Sandboxed Python execution |
| `coding` | Code-editing helpers (LSP-backed) |
| `vision` | Image analysis |
| `image_gen` | Image generation and image-to-image editing |
| `video` / `video_gen` | Video analysis / video generation |
| `x_search` | X (Twitter) search (X OAuth or API key) |
| `tts` | Text-to-speech |
| `skills` | Skill browsing and management |
| `memory` | Persistent cross-session memory |
| `session_search` | Search past conversations |
| `context_engine` | Pluggable context-engine hooks |
| `project` | Named multi-folder workspace tools |
| `delegation` | Subagent task delegation |
| `cronjob` | Scheduled task management |
| `clarify` | Ask user clarifying questions |
| `todo` | In-session task planning |
| `kanban` | Multi-agent work-queue tools (gated to workers) |
| `debugging` | Extra introspection tools (off by default) |
| `safe` | Minimal low-risk toolset for locked-down sessions |
| `spotify`, `homeassistant`, `discord`, `discord_admin`, `feishu_doc`, `feishu_drive`, `yuanbao` | Service integrations (gated on their credentials) |

Tool changes take effect on `/reset` (new session) — never mid-conversation, to preserve prompt caching.

## Voice

### STT (Voice → Text)

Voice messages from messaging platforms are auto-transcribed.

```yaml
stt:
  enabled: true
  provider: local   # local (faster-whisper, free) | groq | openai | mistral | elevenlabs | deepinfra
  local:
    model: base     # tiny, base, small, medium, large-v3
```

Auto-detect priority: local faster-whisper (`pip install faster-whisper`) → Groq (`GROQ_API_KEY`, free tier) → OpenAI (`VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY`) → Mistral Voxtral (`MISTRAL_API_KEY`).

### TTS (Text → Voice)

| Provider | Env var | Free? |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Edge TTS (default) | None | Yes |
| ElevenLabs | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | Free tier |
| OpenAI | `VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY` | Paid |
| MiniMax | `MINIMAX_API_KEY` | Paid |
| Mistral | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | Paid |
| Gemini | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Free tier |
| NeuTTS / Piper / KittenTTS (local) | None | Free |

Voice commands: `/voice on` (voice-to-voice), `/voice tts` (always voice), `/voice off`.
